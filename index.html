Surrounded by figures like Greta Gerwig, BC ’06; Gloria Steinem; and Beanie Feldstein, Fisher recalls the mesmerizing, powerful ambiance of the room. </p> <p class="g-body paragraph"> “I was just sitting at the table with … powerful women who were from the industry, and just pinching myself because there’s a feeling of comfort and ease and power in being amongst these women and female-identified filmmakers,” Fisher, who directed the feature film “<a href="https://www.columbiaspectator.com/arts-and-entertainment/2021/03/11/director-luchina-fisher-presents-the-resilience-and-joyfulness-of-a-black-transgender-woman-in-mama-gloria/">Mama Gloria</a>,” said. “It was just so nurturing and inspiring, and you don't get that at every festival, where you just feel so comfortable, like you’re just with your people.” </p> <p class="g-body paragraph"> This year, however, there are no receptions, no live screenings, and no in-person panels—the 11th annual Athena Film Festival is completely virtual. Instead of a weekend packed with dozens of films and events, the festival has been spread out across the entire month of March, with films accessible to watch at any time within their scheduled weeks. </p> <p class="g-body paragraph"> Yet, as Fisher notes, the goal of the festival remains the same: to celebrate the achievements of women filmmakers and to give them a platform to share their stories and work. </p> <p class="g-body paragraph"> “I love that this film festival is really about heroic women or women who are making a difference in our world, that that’s what these films represent,” Fisher said. “I can’t think of a more perfect place for the New York premiere than Athena.” </p> <p class="g-body paragraph"> With the uncertainties of the pandemic, festival organizers struggled to find the best way to capture the same welcoming and awe-inspiring dynamic that Fisher remembered. According to Kory Louko, BC ’17 and postbaccalaureate fellow for the Athena Film Festival, organizers had developed an in-person festival plan, a hybrid plan, and a fully virtual plan; it was not until September that the festival made the executive decision to go completely virtual. </p> <p class="g-body paragraph"> “It was really a struggle working over the summer, because not only is everything changing around you and you don’t really know week to week what your job is going to look like, you’re also kind of doing twice or triple the work to try to plan for these different contingencies,” Louko said. </p> <p class="g-body paragraph"> The decision to move all film screenings and events online came after several other notable festivals, such as Sundance and South by Southwest, organized programming in fully virtual formats. Athena organizers attended virtual panels hosted by organizations such as FilmEx Film Festival Alliance, which has helped the Athena Film Festival address problems related to accessibility, curation, and sponsorship in a virtual environment. </p> <p class="g-body paragraph"> However, for many filmmakers showcasing films at the Festival this year, the virtual festival run has created a divide between the creators and the viewers, a relationship that fosters conversation and community. Fisher was supposed to premiere “Mama Gloria” in Chicago, the home of the the titular Gloria Allen, a Black transgender woman who founded a school that taught young women social graces for homeless transgender youth in Chicago. </p> <p class="g-body paragraph"> “So many people [in Chicago] know her—her family is there, support is there, it would have been amazing to be on stage talking about the film—and I missed that gathering to watch films together and experience it with a crowd of people,” Fisher said. </p> <p class="g-body paragraph"> Director Rachel Fleit, whose short film “Ava & Bianca” follows the lives of two transgender women filmmakers, also shares this sentiment, especially given that she completed much of the editing for her film remotely. </p> <p class="g-body paragraph"> “I think actually as a filmmaker, you kind of want to be able to sit in the audience while people are watching your movie on a big screen. It’s like the best feeling ever,” Fleit said. </p> <p class="g-body paragraph"> For Miranda Winters and Rocky Romano, who co-directed the short film “We Can’t Breathe” about a female activist in response to the Black Lives Matter protests last summer, the virtual season has restricted them from seeing the reactions of viewers, many of whom were likely involved with the protests in some way. While the directors acknowledge that virtual film festivals have been crucial to telling such pressing stories about the work of female activists, they still miss the experience of seeing their film displayed on big screens, for viewers who may walk away from the film with a greater understanding of the protests and the Black Lives Matter movement. </p> <p class="g-body paragraph"> “To take the film festival experience away from the filmmaker is like ripping the heart out of the filmmaker,” Romano said. “Everyone’s been doing a great job overcoming this and doing it virtually, but when you work really hard on a film and a project, there’s not a lot of accolades and pats on the back. Really, film festivals are where you get that chance, and all your suffering and passion gets a small little moment of glory and [being] highlighted and just the interaction.” </p> <p class="g-body paragraph"> The entirety of “We Can’t Breathe,” which lasts for eight minutes and 46 seconds, was filmed during the COVID-19 pandemic, with much of the footage taken by the film’s producer Rayna Zemel. According to Romano, the film includes footage from 50 to 60 days of the summer’s Black Lives Matter protests, taken on both professional video equipment and cellphones. This in-person filming posed challenges for the team: On top of fears of COVID-19 transmission, many protestors were concerned about being filmed. </p> <p class="g-body paragraph"> With a full filming and editing process of just a few months, the team had to create a final product that captured the complexities of the summer’s protests. Despite the lack of in-person film festivals, the team remarked that viewers at Athena and similar film festivals can still join in solidarity with others in dismantling systems of oppression. </p> <p class="g-body paragraph"> “What I find fascinating about film is for eight minutes to an hour and a half, you actually shut up and listen; you can’t really talk back to the TV, so it’s an opportunity to really share something with somebody without them thinking about an answer or reply, where they actually sit back and actually absorb,” Romano said. </p> <p class="g-body paragraph"> Yoruba Richen, who directed the feature “How It Feels to Be Free,” noted that some of her filming had to adapt to pandemic safety protocols, with interviews filmed remotely on Zoom and a virtual editing process. The film, which includes Alicia Keys among its executive producers, follows the art and activism of six Black female performers—Lena Horne, Abbey Lincoln, Diahann Carroll, Nina Simone, Cicely Tyson, and Pam Grier. </p> <p class="g-body paragraph"> Though Richen acknowledged that virtual film festivals have allowed for larger audiences than in-person ones, she also lamented that the team missed out on having the film shown more widely over the past few months, given that the industry’s production halt hindered her from selling the film. </p> <p class="g-body paragraph"> “Of course, we lose the networking, the in-person networking, just also watching a film together and that energy that you have in the room—those are some of my best experiences of watching films,” Richen said. </p> <p class="g-body paragraph"> For directors showcasing their films at Athena from outside of the country, COVID-19 has made the film season much more difficult and confusing. Leonor Zúniga, the Nicaraguan director behind the film “Exiled,” has had to deal with this confusion abroad, as well as backlash from her home country. </p> <p class="g-body paragraph"> “Exiled” explores the life of Zoilamérica Ortega Murillo, the adopted daughter of the President of Nicaragua Daniel Ortega, who has publicly accused Ortega of rape. Zúniga created the entire film in secret and, afraid that the government would find out about the film, could not apply for funding. She fled Nicaragua and settled in Costa Rica, where she plans to remain until democracy is installed in her home country. </p> <p class="g-body paragraph"> Zúniga has shown her film virtually in London and in the United States, where she has received glowing reviews. Yet she had not been able to share it at movie theaters in Nicaragua, though she said that she will soon share the film for one month in Nicaragua to show residents the truth about Ortega’s past, even at the risk of upsetting supporters of the government. </p> <p class="g-body paragraph"> Though many filmmakers experienced isolation from viewers at virtual festivals, Zúniga felt that the pandemic and virtual film screenings actually allowed her and her viewers to feel less lonely and to become more educated about the Nicaraguan political crisis. </p> <p class="g-body paragraph"> “Before the pandemic, my country has been dealing with the most difficult crisis that we have had in the last 30 years, that forced a lot of people like us to leave our country,” Zúniga said. “I felt really lonely because the world continued moving and just a few people paid attention to what is happening in Nicaragua. So in a way, when the pandemic happened and a lot of people were affected by it, I feel less lonely.” </p> <p class="g-body paragraph"> In order to help bridge the spatial gaps between directors and viewers, the Athena Film Festival has created a Discord channel, where everyone can discuss the films featured in the festival and ask questions of filmmakers and panelists to continue conversations inspired by the films. </p> <p class="g-body paragraph"> To encourage accessibility, the Athena Film Festival offers a special section on its website for films with closed captioning, panels with closed captioning, and pre-recorded Q&As and panels. Anyone in the United States with internet access can participate in viewings and panels, and films and shorts programs each cost $12. </p> <p class="g-body paragraph"> According to Louko, the film industry “has been incredibly behind” on handling issues of accessibility in film festivals. Many film festivals charge incredibly high prices for admission, and transportation to many of these festivals can cost just as much as the price to see the films. For people with a disability, seeing the screen or navigating the space poses additional challenges. </p> <p class="g-body paragraph"> To address issues of accessibility, the Festival is hosting a panel called “Disability Access and Visibility in Film and Television,” as well as featuring a shorts program called “Nothing About Us Without Us,” which dissects the visibility and representation of women and people with disabilities in film. </p> <p class="g-body paragraph"> “I think it’s kind of two things. ... It’s partially because we’re going online that we’re able to do a lot of these things, and we’re thinking about a lot of these things, but it’s also ... because there are incredible disabled activists out there pushing people to be doing these things,” Louko said. </p> <p class="g-body paragraph"> Fleit, whose film is included in “Nothing About Us Without Us,” believes that having the ability to see films in one’s living room does have its advantages, especially when viewers can select what they want to see and when to see it, as opposed to buying a pass for a weekend event. </p> <p class="g-body paragraph"> “I like the idea of the more broad approach, where you get to just see a movie that you’re really interested in seeing from the comfort of your living room, and you get to pause it and go and have a snack,” Fleit said. </p> <p class="g-body paragraph"> Dorothy Allen-Pickard, director of “Material Bodies,” a film focused on the relationship between amputees and their limbs, highlighted recent efforts to challenge ableism in film, both on-screen and behind the camera. Although she noted that the Athena Film Festival takes a social and political approach to its programming, she also cautioned that, especially in a virtual setting, film festivals with narrow focuses can bias towards certain audiences, therefore, limiting the work the focused programming can do. </p> <p class="g-body paragraph"> “On the one hand, it can offer visibility if you’re in a program with, for example, other women filmmakers or films that are also about disability. And then, on the other hand, actually you limit the scope of the audience who are then going to go to watch those films,” Allen-Pickard said. </p> <p class="g-body paragraph"> For Yuan Yuan, a Master of Fine Arts candidate at the New York University Tisch School of the Arts and the director of “Heading South,” virtual film festivals allow for greater visibility for women and filmmakers of color. Yuan and her peers have also been able to attend online workshops to improve writing and filmmaking skills. However, she still has reservations about the overall connectedness of virtual festivals. </p> <p class="g-body paragraph"> “I think it’s easier to ask questions as well [at] all those panels, but I feel, one thing is about all those other panelists with this online, it’s really hard to know if you really have a relationship with that person,” Yuan said. </p> <p class="g-body paragraph"> Although audiences are spread out across the country, Kate Hackett, who directed the short film “Oleander,” feels as though the increased accessibility of festivals can bring people together through social media as well. </p> <p class="g-body paragraph"> “I actually hope that after the pandemic, we’ll be able to keep open some of those online slots at festivals that make the festivals more accessible,” Hackett said. “I attended several virtual screenings at Sundance this year, and then after the screening I went on Twitter, and there were filmmakers all over the world who instantly were weighing in with their opinions about the films. That was so exciting to see comments from all over the world, coming from people who might not be able to attend or be able to attend every year.” </p> <p class="g-body paragraph"> Dana Reilly, director of the short “Ms. Diva Trucker,” which centers on the experiences of a female long-haul trucker, remarked that Athena has put significant attention to attracting diverse audiences by offering substantial discounts to people who would not otherwise be able to attend. At the same time, she added that film festivals sometimes lose the sense of urgency for viewers to absorb the film’s messages. </p> <p class="g-body paragraph"> “If I publish something online and open it up to the public, people feel as though they can watch it any time; there’s no need to watch it; there’s a lot of competing content on the internet,” Reilly said. “The festival provides … curation and name recognition. People think that there’s something more valuable about this story or a reason that it’s being elevated because it was carefully selected by such a prestigious institution, and the fact that it’s only available for a limited time hopefully, pushes people to take advantage of limited availability.” </p> <p class="g-body paragraph"> Similarly, Kate Novack, who produced the short “Hysterical Girl,” which explores Freud’s only major case study of a woman, agreed that Athena has become more accessible with greater viewership and participation while being “thoughtful, reflective of the urgency of the current moment.” </p> <p class="g-body paragraph"> Although many filmmakers featured at Athena desperately wish for the return to in-person screenings, many have found a community with other filmmakers and audience members. The past year has halted production schedules, canceled festivals, and isolated film crews, but directors discovered that now more than ever these films—covering everything from disability representation in media to Indigenous rights to advances in STEM—must be seen, whether on a big screen at a drive-in showcase or on a cozy couch at home. </p> <p class="g-body paragraph"> “Hopefully when we are post-COVID, or at least mostly vaccinated, we can get on sets again and make magic, because filmmaking really is a team sport. You can't do this alone, and you don't want to,” Fisher said. “It’s really about bringing in all these different skills and talents to create something bigger than what you could do individually.” </p> <p class="g-body paragraph"> <i>Arts & Entertainment Editor Noah Sheidlower can be contacted at </i><a href="mailto:noah.sheidlower@columbiaspectator.com"><i>noah.sheidlower@columbiaspectator.com</i></a><i>.
